# Persistence

Data persistence patterns using JPA entities with CRUD operations, complex entity relationships, composite keys, inheritance strategies, and JPQL queries for database interactions.

## Examples

- **address-book** - JPA entities with JSF frontend using CRUD operations via EntityManager
- **order** - JPA entity relationships with composite keys and join tables
- **roster** - JPA inheritance strategies, JPQL queries, and many-to-many relationships
