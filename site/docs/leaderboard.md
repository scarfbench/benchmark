# :cldk-results-16: Leaderboard

The ScarfBench leaderboard tracks and compares the performance of different AI agents and transformation tools across our benchmark suite of Java application migrations.

## Coming Soon

We are currently developing a comprehensive leaderboard system that will provide:

- **Performance Metrics**: Track success rates, compilation success, test pass rates, and functional equivalence scores
- **Agent Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of different AI agents and transformation tools
- **Framework-Specific Results**: Detailed breakdown of performance across Jakarta EE, Quarkus, and Spring migrations
- **Application Categories**: Results organized by focused examples vs. whole applications
- **Transparency**: Reproducible metrics and open evaluation methodology
- **Community Contributions**: Submit your own agent results for inclusion

## Stay Tuned

Check back soon for the live leaderboard. In the meantime, explore our [benchmark applications](benchmark.md) and [quickstart guide](quickstart.md) to start evaluating your own transformation tools.
