- **decorators** - CDI decorators and interceptors for cross-cutting concerns
- **encoder** - CDI with `@Alternative` implementations for conditional bean selection
- **guessnumber** - CDI with custom qualifiers, producer methods, and scope management
- **producerfields** - CDI producer fields for EntityManager injection and resource management
- **producermethods** - CDI producer methods with custom qualifiers for bean selection
- **simplegreeting** - Basic CDI dependency injection with `@Inject` and custom qualifiers
